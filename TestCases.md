> Question:
write python code to check if a string and inverse of that string is same

> Answer:

To check if a string and its inverse (the string obtained by reversing the characters) are the same, you can use the following Python code:
```python
def has_same_reverse(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
```
This function takes in a string `s` as an argument, and returns `True` if the string is the same as its reverse (the inverse of itself), or `False` otherwise.

Here's how to use this function:
```python
# Check if "hello" and its inverse are the same
print(has_same_reverse("hello"))  # Output: True
```
You can call this function with any string you want, and it will return `True` or `False` depending on whether the string is the same as its reverse.
